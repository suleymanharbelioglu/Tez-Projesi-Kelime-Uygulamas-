-

 This is a word learning application.
 It contains the 1000 most commonly used words in English.
 With the "Select Word" button on the homepage, the user is directed to the word selection page.
Words marked as "I Know" in the word selection are directly transferred to the known words page. Words marked as "I Want to Learn" are directly transferred to the unknown words list. The user can select between a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 words to learn.
 Once a sufficient number of words are selected, the user is directed to the "Practice" page via the "Practice" button on the homepage. On this page, the user is asked randomly whether the given word's Turkish meaning or its English meaning is correct among the selected words. If the same word is answered correctly 3 times in a row, the word is transferred to the "Known Words" list. With one wrong answer, the correct answers are reset.
 The user can navigate to the "Profile" page using the navigation bar below and see how many of all the words they know or don't know and access the list of these words
